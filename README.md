## Problem statement: 
Recently, it has been proven that health is very important for a human being and diet plays a vital role in oneâ€™s health. It is advised by numerous health organisations that everyone should to keep a track of their calorie intake to improve their diet and avoid junk. We will use our application to help families improve their diet by inputting their meals every day.

## Assumption: 
* Age lies between the range 12-100.
* The maximum family size is 50.
* Each food item entered is particular to a member of the family.


## Problem setting: 
We want every member of the family to stay aware of their diet, so they can stay fit and healthy in the long term. Hence, we aim on making a Calorie Tracker, wherein all the members of a family can aim to acheive the optimum calorie intake and keep record of their daily calorie intake to eat healthy. 

## Features
* Adding 'n' numbers of members of the family 
* Outputting the optimum daily calorie intake for each member according to their weight, height, age and gender. 
* Adding/deleting/modifying the food intake list for each member of the family by gathering information from a database
* Adding new food items (if item does not exist in the database) to the food calorie database
* Daily and monthly record of each members food intake.
